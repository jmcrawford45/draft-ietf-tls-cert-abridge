              Abridged Compression for WebPKI Certificates
                 draft-jackson-tls-cert-abridge-latest

Abstract

   This drafts defines a WebPKI specific scheme for use in TLS
   Certificate Compression [TLSCertCompress].  The compression scheme
   relies on a static dictionary consisting of a snapshot of the root
   and intermediate certificates used in the WebPKI.  The result is a
   substantial improvement over the existing generic compression schemes
   used in TLS, equitable for both CAs and website operators and avoids
   the need for trust negotiation or additional error handling.  As the
   scheme removes the overhead of including root and intermediate
   certificates in the TLS handshake, it paves the way for a transition
   to TLS certificates using post-quantum signatures and has an outsized
   impact on QUIC's handshake latency due to limits on the size of the
   server's initial message flight.  This compression scheme may also be
   of interest in other situations where certificate chains are stored,
   for example in the operation of Certificate Transparency logs.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   When a server responds to a TLS Client Hello, its initial flight of
   packets is limited in size by the underlying transport protocol.  If
   the initial flight of packets exceeds the size limit, the server must
   wait for the client to acknowledge receipt, incurring the latency
   penalty of an additional round trip before the handshake can
   complete.  For TLS handshakes over TCP, the maximum size of the
   server’s initial flight is typically around 14,500 bytes.  For TLS
   handshakes in QUIC, the limit is much lower at a maximum of 4500
   bytes ([RFC9000], Section 8.1).

   The existing compression schemes used in [TLSCertCompress] have been
   shown to deliver a substantial improvement in QUIC handshake latency
   [FastlyStudy], [QUICStudy] by reducing the size of server's
   certificate chain and so fitting the server's initial messages within
   a single flight.  However, in a post-quantum setting, the signatures
   and public keys used in a TLS certificate chain will be typically 10
   to 40 times their current size and cannot be compressed with existing
   TLS Certificate Compression schemes.  Consequently studies [SCAStudy]
   [PQStudy] have shown that post-quantum certificate transmission
   becomes the dominant source of latency in PQ TLS with certificate
   chains alone expected to exceed even the TCP initial flight limit.
   This motivates alternative designs for reducing the on-wire size of
   post-quantum certificate chains.

1.2.  Overview

   This draft introduces a new TLS Certificate Compression scheme which
   is intended specifically for use on the WebPKI.  It makes used of a
   shared dictionary between client and server consisting of all
   intermediate and root certificates contained in the root stores of
   major browsers sourced from the Common CA Database [CCADB].  As of
   May 2023, this dictionary would be 2.6 MB in size and consist of
   roughly 1500 intermediate certificates and 150 root certificates.
   The disk footprint can be reduced to effectively zero as many clients
   (such as Mozilla Firefox & Google Chrome) are already provisioned
   with their trusted intermediate and root certificates for
   compatibility and performance reasons.

   Using a shared dictionary allows for this compression scheme to
   deliver dramatically more effective compression, reducing an entire
   certificate chain to roughly 25% of its original size, rather than
   the 75% achieved by existing generic schemes.  Firstly, the
   intermediate and root certificates are compressed to a couple of
   bytes each and effectively no longer contribute to the wire size of
   the certificate chain.  Secondly, the end-entity certificate can be
   further reduced by reference to strings in the shared dictionary.  A
   preliminary evaluation of this scheme suggests that 50% of
   certificate chains in use today fit in under 1000 bytes and 95% fit
   in under 1500 bytes.  This is substantially smaller than can be
   achieved with the use of existing TLS certificate compression schemes
   and the suppression of CA certificates as proposed in [SCA].  This is
   because whilst [SCA] removes the intermediate and root certs from the
   chain entirely, this also removes the redundancy that generic TLS
   certificate compression schemes exploit.

   It is also important to note that as this is only a compression
   scheme, it does not impact any trust decisions in the TLS handshake
   or perform trust negotiation.  A client can offer this compression
   scheme whilst only trusting a subset of the certificates in the CCADB
   snapshot, similarly a server can offer this compression scheme whilst
   using a certificate chain which does not chain back to a WebPKI root.
   Similarly, a new root or intermediate can be included in CCADB and
   static dictionary at the start of their application to the root store
   and if their application is approved will benefit from this
   compression scheme from the very first day of trust.  As a result
   this scheme is equitable in so far as it provides equal benefits for
   all CAs in the WebPKI, doesn't privilege any particular end-entity
   certificate or website and allows WebPKI clients to make individual
   trust decisions without fear of breakage.

1.3.  Relationship to other drafts

   This draft defines a certificate compression mechanism suitable for
   use with TLS Certificate Compression [TLSCertCompress].

   The intent of this draft is to provide an alternative to CA
   Certificate Suppression [SCA] as it provides a better compression
   ratio, can operate in a wider range of scenarios (including out of
   sync clients or servers) and doesn't require any additional error
   handling or retry mechanisms.

   CBOR Encoded X.509 (C509) [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert-05]
   defines a concise alternative format for X.509 certificates.  If this
   format were to become widely used on the WebPKI, defining an
   alternative version of this draft specifically for C509 certificates
   would be beneficial.

   Compact TLS, (cTLS) [I-D.ietf-tls-ctls-08] defines a version of
   TLS1.3 which allows a pre-configured client and server to establish a
   session with minimal overhead on the wire.  In particular, it
   supports the use of a predefined list of certificates known to both
   parties which can be compressed.  However, cTLS is still at an early
   stage and may be challenging to deploy in a WebPKI context due to the
   need for clients and servers to have prior-knowledge of handshake
   profile in use.

   TLS Cached Information Extension [RFC7924] introduced a new extension
   allowing clients to signal they had cached certificate information
   from a previous connection and for servers to signal that the clients
   should use that cache instead of transmitting a redundant set of
   certificates.  However this RFC has seen little adoption in the wild
   due to concerns over client privacy.

   Handling long certificate chains in TLS-Based EAP Methods [RFC9191]
   discusses the challenges of long certificate chains outside the
   WebPKI ecosystem.  Although the scheme proposed in this draft is
   targeted at WebPKI use, defining alternative shared dictionaries for
   other major ecosystems may be of interest.

1.4.  Status

3.   Abridged Compression Scheme

   This section describes a compression scheme suitable for compressing
   certificate chains used in TLS.  The scheme is defined in two parts.
   An initial pass compressing known intermediate and root certificates
   and then a subsequent pass compressing the end-entity certificates.
   This scheme is used by performing the compression step of Pass 1 and
   then the compression step of Pass 2.  Decompression is performed in
   the reverse order.

   *TODO:* Abridged is a placeholder name until someone comes up with a
   better one.

   The compression scheme in this draft has a number of parameters as
   listed below.  Future versions of this draft would use different
   values for these parameters and use a different TLS Certificate
   Compression scheme code point.

   *  CCADB_SNAPSHOT_TIME - 2023-01-01 00:00:00Z

   *  CT_CERT_WINDOW - 2022-12-01 00:00:00Z to 2023-01-01 00:00:00Z

3.1.  Pass 1: Intermediate and Root Compression

   This pass relies on a shared listing of intermediate and root
   certificates known to both client and server.  As many clients (e.g.
   Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome) already ship with a list of
   trusted intermediate and root certificates, this pass allows for the
   members of the existing list to be included, rather than requiring
   them to have to be stored separately.  This section first details how
   the client and server enumerate the known certificates, then
   describes how the listing is used to compress the certificate chain.

3.1.1.  Enumeration of Known Intermediate and Root Certificates

   The Common CA Database [CCADB] is operated by Mozilla on behalf of a
   number of Root Program operators including Mozilla, Microsoft,
   Google, Apple and Cisco.  The CCADB contains a listing of all the
   root certificates trusted by the various root programs, as well as
   their associated intermediate certificates and new certificates from
   applicants to one or more root programs who are not yet trusted.

   At the time of writing, the CCADB contains around 150 root program
   certificates and 1500 intermediate certificates which are trusted for
   TLS Server Authentication, occupying 2.6 MB of disk space.  As this
   listing changes rarely and new inclusions typically join the CCADB
   listing year or more before they can be deployed on the web, the
   listing used in this draft will be the relevant certificates included
   in the CCADB at CCADB_SNAPSHOT_TIME.  Further versions of this draft
   may provide for a listing on a new cutoff date or according to a
   different criteria for inclusion.

   *DISCUSS:* Is minting a new draft every year or two acceptable?  If
   not, this draft could be redesigned as its own extension and
   negotiate the available dictionaries which could then change
   dynamically.  A sketch of that approach is discussed in Appendix B.

   The algorithm for enumerating the list of compressible intermediate
   and root certificates is given below:

   1.  Query the CCADB for all known root and intermediate certificates
       [CCADBAllCerts] as of CCADB_SNAPSHOT_TIME

   2.  Remove all certificates which have the extendedKeyUsage extension
       without the TLS Server Authentication bit or anyExtendedKeyUsage
       bit set.

   3.  Remove all certificates whose notAfter date is on or before the
       cutoff date.

   4.  Remove all roots which are not marked as trusted or in the
       process of applying to be trusted by at least one of the
       following Root Programs: Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Apple.

   5.  Remove all intermediate certificates whose parent root
       certificates are no longer in the listing.

   6.  Remove any certificates which are duplicates (have the same
       representation as as sequence of DER bytes)

   7.  Order the list by the notBefore date of each certificate,
       breaking ties with the lexicographic ordering of the SHA256
       certificate fingerprint.

   8.  Associate each element of the list with the concatenation of the
       constant 0x99 and its index in the list represented as a uint16.

   *DISCUSS*: In the future, CCADB may expose such a listing directly.
   A subset of these lists is available in benchmarks/data in the draft
   Github repository.

3.1.2.  Compression of CA Certificates in Certificate Chain

   Compression Algorithm:

   *  Input: The byte representation of a Certificate message as defined
      in [TLS13] whose contents are X509 certificates.

   *  Output: opaque bytes suitable for transmission in a
      CompressedCertificate message defined in [TLSCertCompress].

   1.  Parse the message and extract a list of CertificateEntrys,
       iterate over the list.

   2.  Check if cert_data is byte-wise identical to any of the known
       intermediate or root certificates from the listing in the
       previous section.

       1.  If so, replace the opaque cert_data member of
           CertificateEntry with its adjusted three byte identifier and
           copy the CertificateEntry structure with corrected lengths to
           the output.

       2.  Otherwise, copy the CertificateEntry to the output.

   3.  Prepend the correct length information for the Certificate
       message.

   The resulting output should be a well-formatted Certificate message
   payload with the known intermediate and root certificates replaced
   with three byte identifiers.

   The decompression algorithm is simply repeating the above steps but
   swapping any recognized three-byte identifier in a cert_data field
   with the DER representation of the associated certificate.

3.2.  Pass 2: End-Entity Compression

   This section describes a pass based on Zstandard [ZSTD] with
   application-specified dictionaries.  The dictionary is constructed
   with reference to the list of intermediate and root certificates
   discussed earlier in Section 3.1.1.

   *DISCUSS:* This draft is largely agnostic as to which underlying
   compression scheme is used as long as it supports dictionaries.  Is
   there an argument for use of an alternative scheme?

3.2.1.   Format of Shared Dictionary

   The dictionary is built by systematic combination of the common
   strings used in certificates by each issuer in the known list
   described in Section 3.1.1.

   *TODO:* This section remains a work in progress.  The goal is to
   produce a dictionary of competitive size and similar storage
   footprint to a trained Zstandard dictionary targeting end-entity TLS
   certificates.  The procedure below is not yet final and needs
   improvements.

   This dictionary is constructed in three stages, with the output of
   each stage being concatenated with the next.

   Firstly, for each intermediate certificate enumerated in the listing
   in Section 3.1.1., extract the issuer field (Section 4.1.2.4 of
   [RFC5280]) and derive the matching authority key identifier
   (Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC5280]) for the certificate.  Order them
   according to the listing in Section 3.1.1.

   Secondly, take the listing of certificate transparency logs trusted
   by major browsers [AppleCTLogs] [GoogleCTLogs] and extract the list
   of log identifiers.  Order them lexicographically.

   Finally, enumerate all certificates contained within certificate
   transparency logs above and issued during CT_CERT_WINDOW.  For each
   issuer in the listing in Section 3.1.1, select the end-entity
   certificate with the lowest serial number.  Extract the following
   extensions from the end-entity certificate:

   *  FreshestCRL

   *  CertificatePolicies

   *  CRLDistributionPoints

   *  AuthorityInformationAccess

   If no end-entity certificate can be found for an issuer with this
   process, omit the entry for that issuer.

   *DISCUSS:* This dictionary occupies ~ 65 KB of space.  A comparison
   of this approach with a conventional trained dictionary is in
   Section 4.

3.2.1.1.  Compression of End-Entity Certificates in Certificate Chain

   The resulting bytes from Pass 1 are passed to ZStandard [ZSTD] with
   the dictionary specified in the previous section.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that the compressor (i.e. the server) use the following parameters:

   *  chain_log=30

   *  search_log=30

   *  hash_log=30

   *  target_length=6000

   *  threads=1

   *  compression_level=22

   *  force_max_window=1

   These parameters are recommended in order to achieve the best
   compression ratio however implementations MAY use their preferred
   parameters as these parameters are not used during decompression.
   With TLS Certificate Compression, the server needs to only perform a
   single compression at startup and cache the result, so optimizing for
   maximal compression is recommended.  The client's decompression speed
   is insensitive to these parameters.

   *TODO:* These parameters are a work in progress.

4.  Preliminary Evaluation

   *DISCUSS:* This section to be removed prior to publication.

   This draft is a work in progress, however a preliminary evaluation
   based on a few thousand certificate chains is available.  The storage
   footprint refers to the on-disk size required for the end-entity
   dictionary.  The other columns report the 5th, 50th and 95th
   percentile of the resulting certificate chains.

   The evaluation set was a ~75,000 certificate chains from the Tranco
   list.  The opaque trained dictionary was given redacted certificate
   chains with the end-entity subject name and alternative names
   removed.

5.  Security Considerations

   Note that as this draft specifies a compression scheme, it does not
   impact the negotiation of trust between clients and servers and is
   robust in the face of changes to CCADB or trust in a particular
   WebPKI CA.  The client's trusted list of CAs does not need to be a
   subset or superset of the CCADB list and revocation of trust in a CA
   does not impact the operation of this compression scheme.  Similarly,
   servers who use roots or intermediates outside the CCADB can still
   offer the scheme and benefit from it.

6.  IANA Considerations

   *TODO:* Adopt an identifier for experimental purposes.

Appendix B.  CCADB Churn and Dictionary Negotiation

B.1.  CCADB Churn

   Typically around 10 or so new root certificates are introduced to the
   WebPKI each year.  The various root programs restrict the lifetimes
   of these certificates, Microsoft to between 8 and 25 years 3.A.3
   (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-
   requirements), Mozilla to between 0 and 14 years Wiki page
   (https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles).  Chrome has
   proposed a maximum lifetime of 7 years in the future (Update
   (https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/
   moving-forward-together/)).  Some major CAs have objected to this
   proposed policy as the root inclusion process currently takes around
   3 years from start to finish Digicert Blog
   (https://www.digicert.com/blog/googles-moving-forward-together-
   proposals-for-root-ca-policy).  Similarly, Mozilla requires CAs to
   apply to renew their roots with at least 2 years notice Wiki page
   (https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles).

   Typically around 100 to 200 new WebPKI intermediate certificates are
   issued each year.  No WebPKI root program currently limits the
   lifetime of intermediate certificates, but they are in practice
   capped by the lifetime of their parent root certificate.  The vast
   majority of these certificates are issued with 10 year lifespans.  A
   small but notable fraction (<10%) are issued with 2 or 3 year
   lifetimes.  Chrome's Root Program has proposed that Intermediate
   Certificates be limited to 3 years in the future (Update
   (https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/
   moving-forward-together/)).

   Disclosure required as of July 2022 (Mozilla Root Program
   Section 5.3.2 (https://www.mozilla.org/en-
   US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/#53-
   intermediate-certificates)) - within a week of creation and prior to
   usage.  Chrome require three weeks notice before a new intermediate
   is issued to a new organization.  Policy

B.2.  Dictionary Negotiation

   This draft is currently written with a view to being adopted as a
   particular TLS Certificate Compression Scheme.  However, this means
   that each dictionary used in the wild must have an assigned
   codepoint.  A new dictionary would likely need to be issued no more
   than yearly.  However, negotiating the dictionary used would avoid
   that overhead.

   *DISCUSS:* A sketch for how dictionary negotiation might work is
   below.

   A dictionary is identified by two bytes, with a further two bytes for
   the major version and two more for the minor version.  Whenever a new
   version of a dictionary is issued with only additions of new
   certificates, it requires a minor version bump.  Whenever a new
   version of a dictionary is issued with any removals, it requires a
   major version bump.

   The client lists their known dictionaries in an extension in the
   ClientHello.  The client need only advertise the highest known minor
   version for any major version of a dictionary they are willing to
   offer.  The server may select any dictionary it has a copy of with
   matching identifier and major version number and minor version number
   not greater than the client's minor version number.

   The expectation would be that new minor versions would be issued
   monthly or quarterly, with new major versions only every year or
   multiple years.  This reflects the relative rates of when
   certificates are added or removed to the CCADB listing.
